# ThemeIsle Icons

ThemeIsle Icons is a free icon set with 100 icons that you can use in your projects. We are giving out the source files for free, too. Go ahead and grab them [here](https://themeisle.com/free-icons)!

## Getting Started
You can use the icons by simply including the CDN link in your ```head```:

```html 
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/themeisle-icons/themeisle-icons.css"> 
``` 

Yoy can also require the icons as a npm dependency by running the following command:
```bash
npm install themeisle-icons --save-dev
```
and after that adding the reference to the icons stylesheet in your head:

```html 
<link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/themeisle-icons/themeisle-icons.css"> 
``` 

## Using the Icons
After you require the stylesheet in your project, you can display the icons by using classes on the `<i>` html tag. For example, you can use the `heart` icon by using the following markup:
```html 
<i class="ti ti-heart"></i> 
``` 

As you can see above, you first have to use the `ti` class, followed by the specific class `ti-heart`.
You can see a full guide for the icon classes [here](https://themeisle.com/free-icons).

## License
We have made these icons available for you to incorporate into your products under the GNU General Public License (GPL). You are free to remix, modify, and share these icons and documentation in your projects as long as the same freedom is preserved in the modified versions.

We would appreciate attribution in your app's about screen or documentation, but it is not required.
